The difference between `useRef<THREE.Mesh>(null!)` and `useRef<THREE.Mesh>(null)` in TypeScript lies in how the type checker
handles the possibility of the ref's `current` property being `null`.

- **`useRef<THREE.Mesh>(null!)`**: The `!` is the non-null assertion operator. By using `null!`, you are telling the
  TypeScript compiler that even though you're initializing the ref with `null`, you _know_ that it will definitely hold a
  value of type `THREE.Mesh` at some point during the component's lifecycle and will never be `null` after initialization[5].
  This suppresses potential nullability errors, but it's your responsibility to ensure this assumption is correct[5]. If the
  ref _does_ end up being `null` when you try to access its properties, you might encounter runtime errors. Adding the `!`
  does clear the warning, but it also makes the value static and might lead to trouble, depending on your use case[5].
- **`useRef<THREE.Mesh | null>(null)`**: Here, you're explicitly telling TypeScript that the ref can hold either a
  `THREE.Mesh` object _or_ `null`[2][7]. This is generally the safer and more accurate approach when you're initializing a
  ref with `null` because it acknowledges the possibility of the value being null. When you use this approach, you will
  likely need to use optional chaining (`?.`) or null checks (`if (ref.current)`) when accessing the `current` property to
  avoid potential errors[5].

**In Summary:**

| Feature          | `useRef<THREE.Mesh>(null!)`                                                                                                                           | `useRef<THREE.Mesh                                                               | null>(null)` |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Type Declaration | Asserts that the ref will _always_ be a `THREE.Mesh` after initialization.                                                                            | Explicitly states that the ref can be either a `THREE.Mesh` or `null`.           |
| Nullability      | Suppresses nullability errors from the TypeScript compiler.                                                                                           | Requires handling potential `null` values with checks or optional chaining.      |
| Risk             | If the ref _does_ end up being `null` when accessed, it can lead to runtime errors.                                                                   | More type-safe, as it forces you to consider the possibility of `null`.          |
| Use Case         | Use with caution when you are absolutely certain that the ref will always be a `THREE.Mesh` after initialization.                                     | Recommended when the ref might be `null` at some points.                         |
| Mutability       | When specifying `null` as the default parameter, but not including it in the type param, you get a ref object with a read-only `current` property[2]. | Including `null` in the type parameter matches the `useRef` to be mutable[1][2]. |

**Recommendation:**

In most cases, `useRef<THREE.Mesh | null>(null)` is the preferred approach because it provides more accurate type information
and encourages safer coding practices by explicitly handling potential `null` values[2]. Use the non-null assertion operator
(`!`) sparingly and only when you are absolutely sure about the ref's value.
