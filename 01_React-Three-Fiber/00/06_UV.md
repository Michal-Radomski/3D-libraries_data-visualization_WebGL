UV coordinates in three.js are a crucial component of texture mapping, which involves applying a 2D image (texture) onto a 3D
model. Here’s a detailed overview of what UV coordinates are and how they function within three.js:

## Definition of UV Coordinates

**UV coordinates** are a set of two-dimensional coordinates (u, v) that correspond to points on a texture. They define how
the texture is mapped onto the surface of a 3D object. The values typically range from 0 to 1, where:

- $$ u $$ represents the horizontal axis (width) of the texture.
- $$ v $$ represents the vertical axis (height) of the texture.

For example, the bottom-left corner of a texture corresponds to (0, 0), while the top-right corner corresponds to (1, 1).

## Purpose in Three.js

In three.js, UV coordinates serve several essential functions:

- **Mapping Textures**: They determine how a texture is applied to the geometry of a mesh. Each vertex of the geometry has
  associated UV coordinates that tell three.js which part of the texture to use for that vertex.
- **Rendering**: When rendering a scene, three.js uses these UV coordinates to fetch the correct pixel from the texture and
  apply it to the corresponding vertex on the mesh.

## Generating UV Coordinates

UV coordinates can be generated manually or automatically depending on the complexity of the geometry:

- **Automatic Generation**: For simple geometries like planes or cubes, three.js can automatically generate UVs. However, for
  more complex shapes, developers often need to calculate and assign UVs manually.

- **Manual Calculation**: When importing models (e.g., from Blender), it’s common to have UV maps pre-defined in the modeling
  software. If not, developers may need to write custom code to generate UVs based on their specific requirements. For
  example, planar mapping can be achieved by mapping vertices' positions directly to UV coordinates based on their world
  positions[2][4].

## Accessing and Modifying UV Coordinates

In three.js, UV coordinates are stored as attributes within `BufferGeometry`. You can access and modify them using methods
like:

```javascript
var uvAttribute = geometry.attributes.uv;

for (var i = 0; i < uvAttribute.count; i++) {
  var u = uvAttribute.getX(i);
  var v = uvAttribute.getY(i);

  // Modify u and v as needed
  uvAttribute.setXY(i, u, v);
}

uvAttribute.needsUpdate = true; // Mark as needing an update for rendering
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to iterate through existing UV coordinates, modify them if necessary, and ensure that
three.js updates the rendering with the new values[4][6].

## Conclusion

UV coordinates are fundamental for effective texture mapping in three.js. Understanding how they work allows developers to
create visually appealing 3D models with accurately applied textures. Whether generated automatically or calculated manually,
managing UVs is an essential skill in 3D graphics development using three.js.
