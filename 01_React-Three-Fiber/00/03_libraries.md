React Spring is a physics-based animation system that complements Three.js's 3D rendering capabilities, allowing developers
to create engaging 3D animations in React applications[1]. React Spring focuses on animation and transitions, while Three.js
is a JavaScript library used for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser[3][4].

Here's a breakdown of their differences and how they work together:

- **Functionality** Three.js is a go-to library for 3D graphics in the browser, while React Spring revolutionizes how
  animations are handled in React applications[1].
- **Animation**: React Spring's physics-based animation system complements Three.js's 3D capabilities, creating
  natural-feeling movements that respond to user interactions with realistic momentum and decay[1]. With React Spring, you
  can smoothly transition camera positions, morph geometries, and animate materials[1].
- **Integration**: React Spring is built specifically for React and Three.js, seamlessly integrating with Three.js components
  and allowing developers to animate 3D objects without worrying about the complexities of Three.js animations[3].
- **React Three Fiber**: React-three-fiber is a renderer that simplifies coding in Three.js by using component-based
  patterns, without compromising anything[4]. React Spring works perfectly with React Three Fiber because they come from the
  same maintainers, and it also has exports specifically created for use with React Three Fiber[5].
- **Hooks and Components**: React Spring uses the `useSpring` hook for simple animations and `useSprings` for multiple
  animated elements[1]. The `animated` component is used instead of DOM or mesh, so instead of using `mesh` you will be using
  `animated.mesh` if you want it to be affected by `react-spring`[5].

React Spring is a physics-based animation library for React that allows developers to create natural-feeling
animations[2][6]. It is inspired by React Motion but focuses on ease of use and performance[7].

Here's how React Spring compares to React Motion:

- **Inspiration:** React Spring draws inspiration from React Motion[7].
- **Ease of Use:** React Spring inherits ease of use from React Motion[7].
- **Performance:** React Spring borrows some powerful performance attributes from React Motion[7].
