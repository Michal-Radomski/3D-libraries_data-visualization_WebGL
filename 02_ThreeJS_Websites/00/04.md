React Spring and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) are both JavaScript animation libraries, but they approach animation in
different ways, making them suitable for different types of projects[1].

Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

- **Animation Type**: React Spring is known for its physics-based animations, aiming for natural motion[1]. GSAP, on the
  other hand, uses timeline-based animations, offering precise control over sequencing[1].
- **Approach**: React Spring takes a declarative approach, which aligns well with React's functional nature[6]. GSAP is more
  imperative, requiring you to define the animation steps directly[1].
- **Ease of Use**: React Spring has a moderate learning curve, requiring an understanding of hooks and physics[1]. GSAP can
  have a steeper learning curve, especially when mastering its advanced features like timelines and plugins[1].
- **Integration with React**: React Spring is built specifically for React, offering seamless integration using hooks[1].
  While GSAP works with React, it wasn't built specifically for it, which can sometimes make managing animations alongside
  React's state a bit tricky[1].
- **Complex Animations**: GSAP is excellent for complex, timeline-based animations, offering more control[1]. React Spring is
  great for fluid transitions and natural motion[1].
- **Gestures**: React Spring requires extra setup for interactive gestures[1]. GSAP requires plugins or additional setup for
  gestures[1].
- **Performance**: GSAP is known for its exceptional performance, even with complex animations[5]. React Spring's performance
  is good for moderate complexity, but physics-based animations can be intensive[1].
- **Ecosystem**: GSAP has an extensive plugin ecosystem, allowing you to extend its functionality[1]. React Spring has
  limited plugin support[1].

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature                | React Spring                  | GSAP                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Animation Type         | Physics-based, natural motion | Timeline-based, highly precise            |
| Approach               | Declarative                   | Imperative                                |
| Ease of Use            | Moderate                      | Steeper learning curve                    |
| Integration with React | Seamless, built for React     | Works with React                          |
| Complex Animations     | Good for fluid transitions    | Excellent for timeline-based animations   |
| Gestures               | Requires extra setup          | Requires plugins or additional setup      |
| Performance            | Good for moderate complexity  | Exceptional, even with complex animations |
| Plugin Ecosystem       | Limited                       | Extensive                                 |
