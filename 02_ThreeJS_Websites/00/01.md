`requestAnimationFrame()` is a JavaScript animation method that tells the browser to call a specific function and update the
animation before the next repaint, allowing animations to run more smoothly and reducing the load on the CPU[1]. It is part
of the HTML5 API and is essential for software developers creating animations on web pages[2].

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- **Functionality** `requestAnimationFrame()` tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the
  browser call a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint[3]. The goal is for smooth animation to
  appear at 60 frames per second (fps)[1][4].
- **Usage** The method takes a single argument, which is a callback function that is executed before each repaint[2]. The
  syntax is `window.requestAnimationFrame(callback);`[1][4]. The callback has one single argument, a `DOMHighResTimeStamp`,
  which indicates the current time for when `requestAnimationFrame()` starts to fire callbacks[3].
- **Smooth Animations** The `timestamp` argument in the callback function can create a smooth animation[2].
- **Optimization** The browser can optimize animations, so they will be smoother. Animations in inactive tabs will stop,
  allowing the CPU to chill and be more battery-friendly[3][4].
- **Non-blocking** Animations with `requestAnimationFrame` are non-blocking, which means that if you make subsequent calls to
  `requestAnimationFrame`, the resulting animations will all occur at the same time[1][4].
- **Starting and stopping** `requestAnimationFrame` also returns an ID you can use to cancel it[1][4].

Here is an example of how to use `requestAnimationFrame()`[2]:

```javascript
function animation(timestamp) {
  // Calculate how much time has passed since the last frame
  let deltaTime = timestamp - lastTime;
  // Update the position of an element on the screen
  element.x += deltaTime * speed;
  // Store the current timestamp for future reference
  lastTime = timestamp;
  // Call requestAnimationFrame again to keep animating
  requestAnimationFrame(animation);
}
```
