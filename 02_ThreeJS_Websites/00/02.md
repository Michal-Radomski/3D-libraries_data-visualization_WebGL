In Three.js, materials determine how a 3D object interacts with light and is rendered on the screen[2]. Here's an overview of
`MeshBasicMaterial`, `MeshStandardMaterial`, and `MeshPhongMaterial`:

- **MeshBasicMaterial:** This is the most basic material in Three.js and is not affected by lights[1][5]. If a material isn't
  specified when creating a mesh, Three.js uses the basic material by default[1]. It's suitable for skinning a mesh with a
  texture when you don't need light reflection[1].

- **MeshPhongMaterial:** This material can create more shiny surfaces[4]. It computes lighting at each vertex[5].

- **MeshStandardMaterial:** This material is similar to `MeshPhongMaterial` but provides more accurate and realistic
  results[4]. Instead of shininess, it uses roughness and metalness properties[4]. The Three.js documentation recommends
  using the standard material as a primary choice for materials[6].
