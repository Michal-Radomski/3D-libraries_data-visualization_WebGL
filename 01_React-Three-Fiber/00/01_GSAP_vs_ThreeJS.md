| **Primary Use**        | 3D graphics and animations                            | High-performance animations across various elements                                        |
| **Core Functionality** | Creates and displays animated 3D graphics using WebGL | Animates CSS, SVG, Canvas, React, Vue, and more                                            |
| **Web Compatibility**  | Requires browsers that support WebGL                  | Compatible with all modern web browsers                                                    |
| **Licensing**          | MIT License (completely free)                         | Freemium model; core is free, advanced features require a paid membership (Club GreenSock) |
| **VR/AR Support**      | Supports Virtual and Augmented Reality via WebXR      | No built-in support for VR/AR                                                              |
| **Performance Focus**  | Optimized for GPU-accelerated 3D graphics             | Optimized for fast and smooth animations                                                   |

## Detailed Functionality

### Three.js

- **Purpose**: Primarily designed for creating and rendering 3D graphics in web browsers. It leverages WebGL to provide
  GPU-accelerated rendering.
- **Features**:
  - Extensive capabilities for 3D modeling, including lights, shadows, and materials.
  - Supports complex scenes and animations.
  - Suitable for creating immersive experiences in virtual and augmented reality.
- **Target Audience**: Ideal for developers focused on intricate 3D graphics, such as game developers or those creating
  interactive visualizations.

### GSAP

- **Purpose**: Focused on high-performance animations across a variety of web elements.
- **Features**:
  - Allows for seamless animations of CSS properties, SVGs, Canvas elements, and more.
  - Offers advanced features like ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations.
  - Known for its speed and efficiency, often outperforming other animation libraries like jQuery.
- **Target Audience**: Best suited for web developers looking to enhance user interfaces with smooth animations and
  transitions.

## Conclusion

In summary, while both GSAP and Three.js are valuable tools in the web development landscape, they cater to different needs.
If your project requires sophisticated 3D graphics and immersive experiences, Three.js is the appropriate choice. Conversely,
if you need to implement high-performance animations across various web elements efficiently, GSAP would be the better
option. Both libraries are open-source and have strong community support, making them accessible for developers at all
levels.
