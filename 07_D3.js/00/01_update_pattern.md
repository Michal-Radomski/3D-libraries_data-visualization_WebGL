The D3.js update pattern, often referred to as the _Enter-Update-Exit_ pattern, is a core concept in D3.js for managing
changes to data-driven visualizations. It ensures that the DOM elements correspond correctly to the underlying data, even as
the data changes over time. Here’s how it works:

## **Key Components of the Update Pattern**

1. **Data Binding with `.data()`**:

   - The `.data()` method binds an array of data to a selection of DOM elements. It divides the selection into three groups:
     - **Enter**: Elements that need to be created because they exist in the new data but not in the DOM.
     - **Update**: Elements that already exist in both the DOM and the new data.
     - **Exit**: Elements that exist in the DOM but are no longer present in the new data[3][4].

2. **Handling Each Phase**:

   - **Enter Selection**:
     - Use `.enter()` to append new elements for incoming data.
     - Example: `selection.enter().append("li").text(d => d.value);`
   - **Update Selection**:
     - Modify attributes or properties of elements that persist between old and new datasets.
     - Example: `selection.text(d => d.value);`
   - **Exit Selection**:
     - Remove elements that no longer have corresponding data.
     - Example: `selection.exit().remove();`[3][5].

3. **Merging Selections**:
   - After `.enter()`, you can merge it with the update selection using `.merge()` for applying shared updates across both
     new and existing elements.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const merged = enterSelection.merge(updateSelection);
     merged.attr("class", "updated-class");
     ```

## **Example Workflow**

Here’s a simplified example of using the D3.js update pattern:

```javascript
const data = [10, 20, 30];

// Bind data
const selection = d3.select("ul").selectAll("li").data(data);

// Enter: Add new list items for new data
selection
  .enter()
  .append("li")
  .text((d) => d);

// Update: Update text for existing items
selection.text((d) => d);

// Exit: Remove items with no corresponding data
selection.exit().remove();
```

## **Common Issues**

- Forgetting to handle all three phases (enter, update, exit) can lead to mismatched or redundant DOM elements[1][7].
- Using `.text()` or other attribute-setting methods incorrectly on only one phase (e.g., enter) instead of both enter and
  update phases can cause unexpected behavior[5][6].

The update pattern is essential for building dynamic and interactive visualizations in D3.js, ensuring smooth transitions and
efficient DOM management.
