In TypeScript, the key differences between a regular array of numbers (`number[]`) and a `Float32Array` involve data type
specificity, memory usage, and performance[1][2][4].

- **Data Type**: A regular `number[]` array in JavaScript can hold any type of number (integer, float, etc.) with double
  precision (64-bit floating point numbers)[2][3]. A `Float32Array`, however, is a typed array that specifically holds 32-bit
  floating-point numbers[1]. This means every element in a `Float32Array` is guaranteed to be a 32-bit float[4].

- **Memory Usage**: `Float32Array` is more memory-efficient when you need to store a large number of floating-point numbers.
  Since it uses 32 bits per number, it consumes half the memory compared to the 64 bits used by the standard `number[]`
  array[2][4].

- **Performance**: `Float32Array` can be faster for certain operations, especially when dealing with large datasets and
  performing mathematical operations on them. The performance test shows `Float32Array` to be, in general, slower[2].
  However, `Float32Array` significantly outperforms standard arrays in almost all operations[5].

- **Use Cases**: `Float32Array` is particularly useful when working with WebGL, audio processing, or other scenarios where
  you need to handle large arrays of floating-point numbers efficiently[4]. Standard arrays are more flexible for
  general-purpose use where you don't have strict requirements on data types or memory usage[2][3].

- **Initialization**: You have to use a constructor: `a = new Float32Array(2);` instead of an array literal
  `a = [3.5, 4.5];`[2]. To use array literals with `Float32Array`, you need to use `new Float32Array([3.5, 4.5])`[2].

Here's a summary in a table:

| Feature        | `number[]` (Array of Numbers) | `Float32Array`            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data Type      | Any number (double precision) | 32-bit floating point     |
| Memory Usage   | Higher                        | Lower                     |
| Performance    | Slower in some operations     | Faster in some operations |
| Flexibility    | More                          | Less                      |
| Initialization | Array literals                | Constructor               |

32-bit floating point and double precision are both ways to represent numbers in computers using floating-point
arithmetic[5]. The single-precision floating-point format, also known as FP32 or float32, typically occupies 32 bits in
computer memory[1]. Double precision, on the other hand, uses 64 bits[1].

**32-bit Floating Point (Single Precision):**

- It is a computer number format that usually takes up 32 bits in computer memory[1].
- It utilizes the IEEE 754 standard, also known as binary32[1][2].
- It represents a wide range of numeric values using a floating radix point[1].
- A 32-bit floating-point number consists of three parts: a sign bit (1 bit), an exponent (8 bits), and a fraction (23
  bits)[2].
- The range of floating-point numbers that can be created is approximately 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38[2].
- It can represent all integers with seven or fewer decimal digits exactly[1].

  **Example:** To find the IEEE 754 32-bit floating-point representation for $$-7.75_{10}$$[3]:

  1.  Determine sign: -7.75 => 1 (since negative)[3]
  2.  Convert to binary: -7.75 = $$ -0111.11_2$$[3]
  3.  Normalized scientific notation = $$1.1111 \times 2^2$$[3]
  4.  Compute biased exponent $$2_{10} + 127_{10} = 129_{10}$$, and convert to binary =$$10000001_2$$[3]
  5.  Write components in binary: sign (1), exponent (10000001), mantissa (11110000000000000000000)[3]
  6.  Final result: $$C0F8\ 0000_{16}$$[3]

**Double Precision:**

- Double precision uses 64 bits[1].
- IEEE 754 specifies this and other floating-point types[1].

The way the sign, significand, and exponent are stored is implementation-dependent[5].

Answer from Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai

In computing, floating-point arithmetic represents real numbers using a significand multiplied by an integer power of a
base[4][5]. The way the significand and exponent are stored is implementation-dependent[4]. 32-bit (single precision) and
64-bit (double precision) floating-point formats are common standards[1].

- **32-bit Floating Point (Single Precision):** Also called FP32 or float32, this format typically occupies 32 bits in
  computer memory[1]. It uses the IEEE 754 standard, also known as binary32[1]. A 32-bit floating-point number consists of a
  sign bit (1 bit), an exponent (8 bits), and a fraction (23 bits)[1]. It provides about 7 digits of precision[3].

  - Pi in 32-bit floating point is accurately represented as 3.141592[3][6].

    - Example of Pi as a 32-bit floating point number: The value of Pi expressed as a 32-bit floating point number, with
      different levels of quantization applied, from Number of Significant Digits (NSD) equal to 8[7].

- **64-bit Floating Point (Double Precision):** Double precision uses 64 bits and also adheres to the IEEE 754 standard[2].
  It provides more digits of precision than single precision[2].

  - Pi (3.141592653589793) can be encoded into a double-precision floating-point number[3][8]. The true value of this
    double-precision number is 3.14159265358979311599796346854[3].

Here's how the value of PI can be represented:

- 32-bit: 3.141592[3][6]
- 64-bit: 3.14159265358979311599796346854[3]

You can store the value of Pi with 1000 digits after the decimal point as a string or by using specialized libraries for
high-precision arithmetic[2]. Here's Pi to 1000 decimal places[1][4][5][6][7][8]:

3.  141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998628034825342117067982148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128481117450284102701938521105559644622948954930381964428810975665933446128475648233786783165271201909145648566923460348610454326648213393607260249141273724587006606315588174881520920962829254091715364367892590360011330530548820466521384146951941511609433057270365759591953092186117381932611793105118548074462379962749567351885752724891227938183011949129833673362440656643086021394946395224737190702179860943702770539217176293176752384674818467669405132000568127145263560827785771342757789609173637178721468440901224953430146549585371050792279689258923542019956112129021960864034418159813629774771309960518707211349999998372978049951059731732816096318595024459455346908302642522308253344685035261931188171010003137838752886587533208381420617177669147303598253490428755468731159562863882353787593751957781857780532171226806613001927876611195909216420198[1][4][5][6][7][8]

Keep in mind that if you're performing calculations with this value, standard JavaScript number types have limited
precision[2]. For more accurate calculations, especially with such a high number of decimal places, you should use a
specialized library that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
