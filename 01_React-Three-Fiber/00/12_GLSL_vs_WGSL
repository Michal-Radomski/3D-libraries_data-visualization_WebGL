GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) are both used for writing shaders, but they have distinct
differences in syntax, features, and use cases.

## GLSL

- **Syntax**: GLSL is C/C++-like, with types declared on the left (e.g., `vec4 color;`).
- **Usage**: Primarily used with OpenGL and WebGL for rendering graphics.
- **Type System**: Requires explicit type declarations for variables.
- **Varyings**: Declared as global variables.
- **Support**: Widely supported across various platforms and browsers.

## WGSL

- **Syntax**: WGSL is Rust-like, with types declared on the right (e.g., `var color: vec4f;`).
- **Usage**: Designed for WebGPU, which is a new graphics API aiming to replace WebGL.
- **Type System**: Supports type inference, allowing for implicit type declarations in some cases.
- **Varyings**: Declared using structures with specific locations for each field.
- **Support**: Currently experimental and not widely supported by browsers without enabling specific features.

### Key Differences:

- **Syntax Style**: GLSL is more traditional like C/C++, while WGSL follows a Rust-like syntax.
- **Type Inference**: WGSL allows for type inference, whereas GLSL requires explicit type declarations.
- **Varying Handling**: WGSL uses structures for varyings, whereas GLSL uses global variables.
- **Platform Support**: GLSL is more established and widely supported, while WGSL is part of the emerging WebGPU standard.

### Choosing Between GLSL and WGSL:

- **GLSL** is recommended for projects requiring stable, widely supported rendering capabilities, especially with WebGL.
- **WGSL** is suitable for developers interested in the future of WebGPU and willing to work with experimental features. It's
  particularly appealing for those familiar with Rust.
