In animation, "ease in," "ease out," and "ease in-out" are easing functions that control the acceleration and deceleration of
an animation to make movements appear more natural[1][2]. Without easing, animations can look stiff and robotic[1].

Here's a breakdown:

- **Ease-in:** The animation starts slowly and then speeds up[1][2]. It's like a car pulling away from a stop[2][4]. This is
  often used for elements entering the viewport or to build anticipation[4].

  - CSS syntax example: `transition-timing-function: ease-in;`[4]

- **Ease-out:** The animation starts quickly and then slows down as it approaches its end[1][2]. It's like a car gently
  coming to a stop[4]. This is often used for elements exiting the screen or to complete user actions smoothly[4].

  - CSS syntax example: `transition-timing-function: ease-out;`[4]

- **Ease-in-out:** This is a combination of both ease-in and ease-out[1][2]. The animation starts slowly, accelerates in the
  middle, and then decelerates at the end[4]. This provides a smooth transition from slow to fast and back again[1].

  - CSS syntax example: `transition: transform 500ms ease-in-out;`[6]

Easing functions are crucial for creating fluid and organic motion in animations, making them more appealing and
realistic[2][4].
